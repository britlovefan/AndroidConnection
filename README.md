Background:

  Designed for the patients who have many medicines to take and need a reminder app to take their pills on time. 
There is a camera detector that takes photo for every pill bottle from time to time, the photo will be then used to do machine
learning and decide the weight of the pill bottle which reflect whether the patients have taken their pills. We need to do less
scanning for every bottles to save energy and as for the user, we need to connect automatically instead of choosing by hand.
